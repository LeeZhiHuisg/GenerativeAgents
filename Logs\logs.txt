Observation: 
In the small village of Miller's Hollow, tensions rise as the townsfolk gather in the town square. 
They are determined to identify the werewolf lurking among them. The recent elimination of Yuka Suzuki has left everyone on edge.
As the discussion begins, the villagers share their suspicions and present their reasoning. 
They recount their observations, actions, and any clues they have gathered so far. 
The werewolf tries to maintain their innocence while deflecting suspicion. Other werewolves collaborate to protect their own.
