2) Form Alliances: I will try to form alliances with other townfolks whom I believe are trustworthy. Together, we can share information and vote strategically to kick out the suspected warewolves.

3) Be Persuasive: As I get easily convinced by other's arguments, I will use this to my advantage by being persuasive and convincing others to vote the same way as I do. I will also try to sway the opinions of those who are still unsure by presenting logical arguments and evidence.
