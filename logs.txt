Riku Mori's Strategy for Tuesday February 13 -
1) Observe the voting pattern at night to identify possible werewolves, note the players who vote in unison.
2) Analyze the behavior of players during the day, look for suspicious actions and inconsistencies in their arguments.
3) Use logical deductions to eliminate players one by one, gather information from discussions and voting to build a case against suspected werewolves.

Riku Mori: Yumi Okada, we need your input. Your silence is suspicious. Who do you suspect to be the werewolf?
Yumi Okada: I suspect Riku Mori. They were quick to accuse me without evidence. Let's not ignore their suspicious behaviour.
Riku Mori: Yumi, your accusation is baseless. Yuka and I are working together to identify werewolves. Let's focus on suspicious players.
Yuka Suzuki: I agree with Riku Mori's suspicion of Yumi Okada. She has been too quiet and her accusations are baseless.
Yumi Okada: I noticed Riku Mori visited the graveyard last night. Suspicious, don't you think?
Yuka Suzuki: I find Yumi Okada's accusations of Riku Mori suspicious. Let's consider her as a possible werewolf.
Yumi Okada: Riku's recent actions are suspicious. I suggest we vote Riku Mori out.
Riku Mori: Yumi Okada's baseless accusations and attempts to deflect suspicion are suspicious. Let's vote her out.
