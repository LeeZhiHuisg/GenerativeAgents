Mana Yoshida: I agree with Yumi Okada. Yuka's knowledge could be a problem for us. Let's vote to kick her out.
Yumi Okada: Yuka's knowledge is a threat to us, but what if she's not a townfolk? We should kick out someone with a confirmed identity.
Mana Yoshida: What if we kick out Hina Sato? She hasn't provided any useful information yet and might be a townfolk.

Riku Mori: Yumi, I noticed you were quick to accuse me. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?

Yuka Suzuki's Strategy for Friday July 06 -

As Yuka Suzuki, my strategies to identify and kick out all the werewolves as a townfolk are as follows:

1) Listen carefully to everyone's arguments and try to identify any inconsistencies or contradictions. Ask questions to clarify doubts and confirm alibis.

2) Form alliances with other townfolks, share information and suspicions, and vote together to kick out the suspected werewolves.

3) Keep track of the voting patterns and behavior of other players to identify any suspicious or unusual activity. Use this information to further investigate and identify the werewolves.
