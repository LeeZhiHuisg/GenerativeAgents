Yuka Suzuki's Strategy for Tuesday February 13 -
Yuka Suzuki:

1) Listen to the arguments of others, and try to gather information from them to identify the werewolves.
2) Be cautious of sudden changes in behavior or suspicious actions by individuals.
3) Collaborate with other townfolks and share information to make a well-informed decision during the voting process.

Yumi Okada's Strategy for Tuesday February 13 -
1) Act like a helpful townfolk in discussions and push for kicking out the most suspicious townfolks.
2) Blame other players for suspicious behavior and try to create confusion among the townfolks.
3) Coordinate with other warewolf, Mana Yoshida, to vote together and eliminate townfolks one by one.

Mana Yoshida's Strategy for Tuesday February 13 -
1) I will try to build a rapport with the townfolks and gain their trust by participating actively in discussions and taking their side against suspected werewolves.
2) I will try to sow seeds of doubt and mistrust among the townfolks by subtly planting false accusations against innocent players and redirecting suspicion towards others.
3) If I am suspected, I will try to come up with a convincing alibi and deflect suspicion towards other players, even if it means sacrificing my fellow werewolf Yumi Okada.

Yumi Okada: "I suggest we kick out Taichi Kato. He's been acting suspiciously and his behavior doesn't add up."
