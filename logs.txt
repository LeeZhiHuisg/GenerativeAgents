Yuka Suzuki: I agree with Mana's suspicion on Hina. We should investigate her further and keep track of her voting pattern.
Hina Sato: I noticed Riku's sudden change in vote during Yumi's elimination. We should investigate their reasoning.
Riku Mori: I noticed Taichi's voting pattern aligns with the werewolves. Let's investigate him further before jumping to conclusions about Hina.
Mana Yoshida: It's interesting how Yuka and Hina are working together to create suspicion on others.
Taichi Kato: I noticed Riku's vote change too. Yuka and Hina's collaboration is suspicious. Let's investigate them further.
Yuka Suzuki: I noticed Yuria's silence during Yumi's elimination. Could Yuria be a werewolf trying to avoid suspicion?

Mana Yoshida: Yuka's and Hina's coordination is suspicious. Yuria, tell us what information you've gathered to help identify the werewolves.
Yuka Suzuki: Yuria's silence during Yumi's elimination and her suspicion of Riku and Taichi seems like a deflection tactic.
I observed Yuka and Hina's suspicious coordination. Taichi's voting pattern aligns with the werewolves. We need to investigate them further.
I noticed Mana's silence during Riku's elimination. We should investigate her and Yuka's involvement in suspicious behavior.
Mana Yoshida: I have been observing Yuka and Hina's behavior. Their sudden change in suspicion seems too coordinated to be a coincidence.
