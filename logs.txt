Yumi Okada: "Hey Mana, it's good to see you here. I heard some rumors about Yuria being a werewolf. Have you noticed anything suspicious about her lately?"
Hina Sato: Hey Taichi, I saw you catching fish earlier. Did you have any luck?
Mana Yoshida: "I haven't noticed anything suspicious about Yuria yet. But we should keep an eye on her."
Taichi Kato: Yeah, I caught a few. It's a good spot here.
Yumi Okada: "Thanks for your input. Let's keep an eye on her and see if anything suspicious comes up."
Hina Sato: Do you have any tips for catching fish here?
Taichi Kato: Yeah, try using a worm as bait. It seems to work well here.
Mana Yoshida: "We should also be careful not to draw too much attention to ourselves. Let's continue to blend in with the townfolks and gain their trust."
