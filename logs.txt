Hina Sato: "Yumi, what makes you suspect Riku? I saw Yuka gathering herbs but Riku's actions are unclear."
Yumi Okada: "I'm suspicious of Riku. Hina, why didn't you mention Riku's actions? I think Riku is collaborating with the werewolves."
Riku Mori: "Hina, did you witness Riku collaborating with the werewolves? Yumi and Mana, what evidence do you have against me?"
Hina Sato: "Yumi, your suspicion of Riku seems baseless. Taichi, what are your thoughts on Yuria's actions during the last vote?"
Mana Yoshida: "Riku, why are you deflecting suspicion towards Hina and Taichi? Yumi, why suggest kicking out Riku instead of Hina?"
Yumi Okada: "Riku, why did you vote for Yuka? I think you're trying to hide something. Hina, have you noticed anything suspicious about Riku?"

Hina Sato: "Riku, your voting pattern is still suspicious. Yumi, Taichi, what do you think? Let's vote out Riku."
Taichi Kato: "I noticed Yumi was quick to vote out Yuka and now she's pushing for Riku. Suspicious behavior, don't you think?"
Hina Sato: "Yumi, why are you so quick to accuse others? Your behavior is suspicious. Let's vote her out."
Taichi Kato: "Hina, your silence is concerning. Yumi and Riku have been vocal, but you have not shared your thoughts. Are you trying to hide something?"
Riku Mori: "Hina, what's your take on Yumi's voting pattern? Mana, why are you so quick to suggest kicking me out?"
Mana Yoshida: "Riku has been quiet despite suspicions. Let's vote them out. Yumi, what are your thoughts?"
Riku Mori: "Yumi, your accusations against me seem baseless. Hina, why do you think Yumi is suspicious? Taichi, what do you think of Mana's eagerness to kick me out?"
Hina Sato: "Yumi, why do you think Riku is the only werewolf left? Taichi, what made you suspicious of Yuka gathering herbs?"
