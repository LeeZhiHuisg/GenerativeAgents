Currently it is Day, the Villagers will lynch someone...

Riku Mori: "Yumi, what do you think about Mana's behavior during the last voting? It seemed suspicious to me."
Yumi Okada: "I noticed Yuka and Riku voting together last round. Could they be working together? We should investigate them more closely."
Yuka Suzuki: "Riku, why did you vote for Hina last round? It seemed like a random choice. And Yumi, why were you quick to suspect Mana? Let's discuss."
Riku Mori: "I agree with Yumi. Yuka and I voted together, but it was based on Mana's suspicious behaviour. Let's focus on finding the werewolf instead of pointing fingers at each other."
Mana Yoshida: "Riku, why did you vote for Yuka last round? It seemed like a random choice. And Yumi, why were you quick to suspect me? Let's discuss."
Taichi Kato: "I noticed Riku and Yuka voted together last time, but now they're pointing fingers at each other. Are they trying to deflect suspicion from themselves?"
