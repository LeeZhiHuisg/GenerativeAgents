3) During night, convince other warewolf to vote out a townfolk and during day, blame others while acting innocent.

-----------------------


Mana Yoshida's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

1) Act as a helpful and friendly electrician to gain trust. Sabotage townfolks' tasks subtly to create confusion.
2) Blame other players for suspicious activity to divert attention from oneself. Vote with the pack to kick out townfolks.
3) Use logical reasoning to manipulate townfolks' decisions. Target the most influential players to weaken their alliance.
