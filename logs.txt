Riku Mori: Yumi Okada, we need your input. Your silence is suspicious. Who do you suspect to be the werewolf?

Riku Mori: Yumi, your accusation is baseless. Yuka and I are working together to identify werewolves. Let's focus on suspicious players.
Yuka Suzuki: I agree with Riku Mori's suspicion of Yumi Okada. She has been too quiet and her accusations are baseless.
Yumi Okada: I noticed Riku Mori visited the graveyard last night. Suspicious, don't you think?
Yuka Suzuki: I find Yumi Okada's accusations of Riku Mori suspicious. Let's consider her as a possible werewolf.
