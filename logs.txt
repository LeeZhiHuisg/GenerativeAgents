3) During night, convince other warewolf to vote out a townfolk and during day, blame others while acting innocent.

-----------------------


Mana Yoshida's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

1) Act as a helpful and friendly electrician to gain trust. Sabotage townfolks' tasks subtly to create confusion.
2) Blame other players for suspicious activity to divert attention from oneself. Vote with the pack to kick out townfolks.
3) Use logical reasoning to manipulate townfolks' decisions. Target the most influential players to weaken their alliance.

Yuria Shimizu's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

1) Observe voting patterns and behavior to identify suspicious players.
2) Collaborate with other townfolks to share information and form alliances.
3) Act convincingly and use persuasive skills to sway the opinions of others during discussions and voting.

-----------------------


Riku Mori's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

1) Observe behavior and voting patterns to identify suspicious individuals.
2) Coordinate with other townfolks to discuss suspicions and gather information.
3) Prioritize completing tasks to prevent werewolf sabotage and gain an advantage in identifying werewolves.

-----------------------


Hina Sato's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

1) Observe behavior patterns: Watch for inconsistencies in behavior and voting patterns to identify suspicious players.
2) Investigate quietly: Talk to players one-on-one and gather information to avoid revealing suspicions to the rest of the group.
3) Prioritize task completion: Completing tasks reduces the number of players and helps identify suspicious behavior by those who sabotage tasks.

-----------------------


Yuka Suzuki's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

As Yuka Suzuki, my strategy to win as a townfolk in the werewolf village game would be:

1) Listen carefully to the arguments of others and try to identify inconsistencies in their stories.
2) Work together with other townfolks and share information to identify and eliminate suspected werewolves.
3) Prioritize completing the tasks to win, but also be vigilant during the voting process to ensure the right person is kicked out.

-----------------------


Taichi Kato's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

Taichi Kato scratches his head, trying to come up with a plan to win the game. Despite being dumb, he knows that he needs to think strategically to identify and kick out the werewolves. Here are his three strategies:

1) Observe patterns and behavior: Taichi will observe the pattern of werewolf voting and behavior during the day to identify potential werewolves.

2) Collaborate with others: Taichi will collaborate with other townfolks to gather information and discuss suspicions to identify the werewolves.

3) Complete tasks: Taichi will prioritize completing tasks and try to identify any werewolves who try to sabotage the tasks.

-----------------------


Yumi Okada's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

1) Act like a trustworthy townfolk by participating in discussions and voting, but subtly sow distrust among the townfolks.
2) Use my position as a farmer in the Cattle Farm to sabotage the townfolks' tasks by secretly damaging the crops or livestock.
3) When accused of being a werewolf, lie convincingly and accuse others to shift suspicion away from myself.

-----------------------


Mana Yoshida's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

1) Try to blend in with the townfolks and act like a responsible electrician to avoid suspicion.
2) Sabotage tasks subtly to prevent the townfolks from completing them without getting caught.
3) Bluff and accuse innocent townfolks to divert attention from myself and my fellow werewolf Yumi Okada.

Yuka Suzuki's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

As Yuka Suzuki, my strategy to win as a Townfolk in the village with werewolves would be:

Mana Yoshida's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

1) Act as a townfolk, sabotage tasks subtly, and vote to kick out one townfolk each night.
2) Bluff as a helpful electrician, fix tasks, and gain trust to sabotage tasks later.

Taichi Kato's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

As Taichi Kato, my strategies to win as a Townfolk in the werewolf-village game are:

1) Observe voting patterns and suspect individuals who vote against townfolks consistently.

-----------------------


Mana Yoshida's Strategy for Wednesday July 18 -

1) Act helpful and cooperative, gain trust by completing some tasks, then start sabotaging to create chaos.

Taichi Kato: "That's interesting. I've never heard of that before. Maybe I should try it out."

As Taichi Kato, an electrician in the village, my strategy as a townfolk to identify and kick out all werewolves would be:

1) Observe and listen to the discussions during the day to identify any suspicious behavior or statements made by other villagers. Take notes to keep track of any patterns or inconsistencies in their stories.

2) Use my knowledge of electrical systems to complete tasks efficiently and quickly, thus preventing the werewolves from sabotaging them. This will help to build trust among the other townfolks and gain their support in identifying the werewolves.

3) Form alliances with other townfolks who I trust and who have similar suspicions about certain villagers. Together, we can work to gather evidence and make informed decisions during the voting process to increase our chances of identifying and kicking out the werewolves.

Yuria Shimizu's Strategy for Friday July 20 -

1) Observe behavior and voting patterns to identify suspicious individuals.
2) Build alliances and trust with other townfolks to increase chances of successful voting.
3) Strategize and prioritize completing tasks to prevent werewolf sabotage and gain townfolks' trust.

-----------------------


Riku Mori's Strategy for Friday July 20 -

1) Observe voting patterns and note suspicious behavior to identify potential werewolves.
2) Collaborate with trusted townfolks and form alliances to gain more information and support.
3) Deduce the identity of werewolves based on task sabotage and behavior during discussions and voting.

-----------------------


Hina Sato's Strategy for Friday July 20 -

1) Observe and analyze voting patterns to identify potential werewolves.
2) Build alliances with trusted townfolks to gain their support in voting out suspicious individuals.
3) Complete tasks efficiently and observe which individuals are not contributing or are sabotaging, they may be werewolves.

-----------------------


Yuka Suzuki's Strategy for Friday July 20 -

As Yuka Suzuki, my strategy to win as a Townfolk in the game of werewolves is as follows:

1) Observe and listen carefully to everyone's arguments and opinions during the day to identify any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
2) Collaborate with other Townfolks to narrow down the list of potential werewolves and vote to kick them out during the day.
3) Ensure the completion of tasks and communicate with others to avoid any sabotage attempts by the werewolves.

-----------------------


Taichi Kato's Strategy for Friday July 20 -

As Taichi Kato, I would like to point out that due to my lack of intelligence, my strategies might not be the most effective, but here are three ways I would try to win as a Townfolk:

1) Listen carefully to the discussion during the day and observe everyone's behavior. Suspect those who are too defensive or too quiet.
2) Try to complete tasks as soon as possible to ensure the progress of the town. Keep an eye out for any sabotages by the werewolves.
3) If I am suspicious of someone, gather evidence and present it to the group. But be careful not to reveal too much information and become a target for the werewolves.

-----------------------


Mana Yoshida's Strategy for Friday July 20 -

1) Act as a helpful electrician to gain trust, while subtly sabotaging tasks to delay the townfolks' progress.
2) Frame other werewolves, create chaos and suspicion among townfolks to deflect attention from myself.
3) Use my werewolf knowledge to manipulate the werewolf vote and eliminate townfolks strategically. Bluff when necessary.

-----------------------


Yumi Okada's Strategy for Friday July 20 -

1) Act as a trustworthy townfolk farmer and always help with tasks to gain their trust.
2) Bluff and frame innocent townfolks as werewolves, leading to their elimination.
3) Secretly sabotage tasks while appearing to work on them, causing delays and mistrust among the townfolks.
